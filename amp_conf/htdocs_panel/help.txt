After that you can:

<ul>
<li> Transfer calls: by dragging the phone icon to the destination you want

Hangup calls: by double clikcing on the red button

Originate calls: by dragging an available extension to an available destination

Conference calls:  You can add a third person to an existing conversation by dragging an available extension to a leg of an already connected call.
