CHANGES to Flash Operator Panel

.19
 Nov 04 2004:

  - Improved call details, now there is a queue/agent information
    window and last call details window.

  - Bugfixes and visual layout tweaks. You can set the highlight color, etc.

  - You can define a distinct style per panel context. See op_style.cfg

  - You can include files in op_buttons.cfg with the keyword 'include =>'

  - The swf client is compressed and much smaller.

  - When op_server.pl recconects, it close flash clients connections to
    force a reconnect and update on their status.

.18
 Oct 29 2004:

  - Ming client is now the default, the new features work with
    that client only.

  - Led color configurable via op_style.cfg

  - More label renaming options 
    (rename to agent name, rename queuememebers, etc)

  - Option to change led color for logged in agents

  - New click to dial feature, accesible via javascript
    (examples in the html subdir)

  - Ability to draw rectangles (see op_buttons.cfg for examples)

  - Added polling for IAX presence 

.17
 Oct 21 2004:

  - Mostly a bug fix release. Fixed the reload button in the ming client.

  - Added polling of agents status on connect 

  - Initial take on showing detail info on each agent

.16
 Oct 20 2004:

  - Bug fixes: parked channel feature works again, ringing state too.

  - Encryption is now optional, you can enable or disable it by changing
    enable_crypto in op_style.cfg (while is this parameter in op_style
    you may ask? well, the client has the ability to request encryption or
    not, op_style.cfg sets not only visual parameters, but any client
    parameter. I might change the configuration file name to op_client.cfg
    in the future. Without encryption the client uses less CPU.

  - Include the option for polling voicemail status together with sip
    peers (poll_voicemail in op_server.cfg)

  - New feature: ability to rename button labels when agents log in (
    rename_label_agentlogin and rename_label_callbacklogin inside
    op_server.cfg)

  - New Ming client included. Ming is a library for generating .swf files
    with wrappers in several languages. I used the perl wrapper to produce
    a complete client. The source is included in the ming-source directory
    The precompiled .swf file is in the html directory together with the
    native flash client. Further development might be done exclusively in
    Ming.

  - The Ming client treats fonts a little diferent. If you enable 
    use_embed_fonts in op_style.cfg, then all the font_family values will
    be overriden by the only embedded font in the .swf. The
    embedded font looks uniform compared to system (or browser) fonts. You 
    *can* use any font_family available in your platform: just disable the 
    use of embed fonts and select the family for each legend in a button.. 
    but you might end up with chopped text depending of the type of font 
    you use.


.15
 Oct 1st 2004:

  - New configuration file format, there is an utility to convert
    your old configuration to the new format. See UPGRADE, and don't
    forget to backup first. Be sure to run the utility only with
    old configuration files, use it once and then remove it just in
    case.

  - Fixed MessageWaiting when channel was in another context

  - MD5 Authentication to Asterisk Manager (md5_auth in op_server.cfg)
  
  - Improved context handling in general. Now you can have a security
    code for each context, as well as meetme rooms to use for bargein.

  - There is no more auto_conf_exten for finding an empty meetme for
    barge-ins. You now have to specify the rooms available for that
    feature with the parameter barge_rooms in op_server.cfg

  - Timers are now polled from Asterisk on initial connect. (If you open
    the panel when a conversation was going, you will see the real duration
    of the call)

  - TEA Encryption for messages sent from server to client. MD5 used for
    hashing the password.

  - Many cosmetical changes to the flash movie, as well as optimizations
    and rewrites. There are new icons, animations, etc.

  - More information available when a call is disconnected, including
    queue status information (completed calls, average holdtime, etc)
    To get the info double click on the arrow when a call is finished.

  - Added ability to mute/unmute meetme participants by clicking on the
    arrow.

  - Supports for register/unregister/unreachable/lagged realtime events
    for SIP and IAX peers

  - You can restrict the drag and drop commands to one button only, see
    index-restrict.html in the html subdirectory

.14
 Jul 28th 2004:

  - You can run the op_server.pl dettached from the console by starting it
    with the parameter '-d'. There are sample init scripts in the init 
    directory for redhat and debian.

  - You can now drag a parked channel and transfer it to an available 
    extension just like any other transfer.

  - Changed to work well with Asterisk RC1 (IAX2 channel names have changed
    from "IAX2[ext@context]" to IAX2/ext@context. Your IAX2 channels in 
    op_buttons.cfg must be renamed if you use RC1. If you do not user RC1,
    it might work as before, but I have not tested it.

  - The flash side has a lot of improvements and changes. The fonts _sans
    and _serif are now embedded, so they will look consistent in different
    client computers (the tradeoff is a bigger swf file). When a channel is 
    offline, the label text will also be grayed out. When dragging an icon, 
    there is now visual feedback for the destination button. Added transparent
    mask to the icons to make drag easier. If the client looses connection to
    the op_server.pl, it will try to reconnect by itself (it does not work 
    on linux, its a flash bug).

  - Also in the flash side, there are new elements. A little arrow showing 
    the direction of the call. And if you double click that little arrow 
    after a call is made, you can see the last call status. The new parameters
    for op_style.cfg are described in UPGRADE

  - There is a new parameter in op_server.cfg: clid_format
    You can choose the format for the caller id to be presented in the client
    The letter 'x' will be replaced with a number, any other text will be
    preserved. 

.13
 Jul 12th 2004:

  - Fixed an annoying bug that prevented the initial status to be displayed
    (the context for wich the panel request events was sent after the
    status events, so they were ignored by the flash client)

  - Fixed another annoying bug, the clid text was of an incorrect height,
    and the drag and drop was erratic because of this

  - Improved the parking display on the channels. Now you have a flashing
    led and a text in the button itself

  - Added a timer with the duration of a call to each button

  - Still more bugs to clean on the trunk feature, please report feedback
    on the mailing list..

.12
 Jul 5th 2004:

  - Added a caller id display on the button itself

  - The status of meetme and queues is queried on initial connect

  - The event handling was rewriten. Now the flash client receives the
    events for its own context (in previous versions, the events were
    broadcasted to all clients)

  - Cleaned the debug output a bit. 

  - You can send a USR1 signal to the server and look at some state 
    variables.

  
.11
 Jun 29th 2004:

  - Added 'trunk' buttons. You can define many buttons for just one user.
    It is not well tested, as I do not have the means to test it. It might
    introduce bugs!

  - Added CRM software integration. You can monitor a button, and when it
    rings, a web page is requested in the url and target you specify, with
    the clid sent as a GET variable.

  - The debug option in op_server.cfg has changed. See the UPGRADE file or
    the online documentation, or the comments on op_server.cfg
  
.10
 Jun 22th 2004:

  - Added Contexts for the panel. You can have one server and several 
    different panels.

  - Added 'Parked calls' as a status for a defined channel/button

  - Fixed important bugs (MWI with contexts not working, transfers not
    working in particular situations)

  - Totally new webpage, for up to date documentation, go there

  - You can send a HUP signal to op_server.pl and it will rewrite the
    configuration files for the flash applet.

  - New RELOAD button in flash, it will reread the server configuration 
    and refresh the display.

.09 
 Jun 8th 2004:

  - Added Message Waiting count. When passing the mouse over the envelope
    icon the status shows the New and Old messages in that mailbox

  - The server sets the CallerID when originating a call.
  
  - Changed the debug parameter in op_server.cfg to a bitmap for greater 
    control off debug output.
    
  - Changed the way it handles extension numbers (column number 4) in 
    op_buttons.cfg. Now you can specify the context where the extension 
    resides by using the syntax:
    
      extension@context  
    
    If the extension is not reachable from the default context, you must 
    specify its context there.
    
  - Changed the way it handles IAX2 channels. To specify an IAX channel you 
    have to specify its name only, without '@context', eg: 
    
      IAX2[john]
     

.08
 Jun 2nd 2004:

  - Added "Extra Info" Input box

      You can write any text you want in that box. When transferring or 
      originating a call, that text will be used as the callerid text for
      that call. This way you can pass usefull information to the person
      you are transferring the call. In order for this feature to work you
      need to modify your dialplan ("extensions.conf"). There is an example
      extensions.conf provided.

  - Configurable layout of the toolbar

      The bar at the top of the flash applet is now configurable. There are
      new parameters in op_style.cfg to adjust the layout:

        clid_label=Extra Info:
        security_label=Security Code:
        btn_help_label=Help
        btn_log_label=Debug
        show_security_code=1
        show_clid_info=2
        show_status=3
        show_btn_help=4
        show_btn_debug=5

      The numbers in the show_xxx varialbes indicates the position in the 
      toolbar. If you do not want to display an element, set it to 0. 

  - Added HELP button and text to the flash movie

      You can add a help.txt file in the same directory as the flash movie
      on your webserver. This file will be displayed inside the help window
      of the flash movie. You can use basic html tags. You *must* start the
      file with the words "text="
       
.07
  May 19th 2004:

  - Added conference buttons

      The channel column (first one) in op_buttons.cfg must be named with 
      the number of the meetme conference. Eg: you have a meetme conference
      number 901, the name of the channel must be '901'. Look at the example
      config.

  - Added tranfer of an empty channel to an already connected call and 
    automatically conference the three parties together

      You have two new parameters in op_server.cfg:

        auto_conference_extension
        conference_context 

      Set them up and look at op_server.cfg for an example configuration for 
      asterisk in extensions.conf and meetme.conf

  - Added origination of calls

      You can drag an available button to another available button. This
      will originate a call from the first channel to the extension defined
      in the desintation button.

  - More readable output log for op_server.pl

.06
  May 12th 2004

  - Added voicemail notification: 

      There is a new parameter in op_buttons.cfg. The last column has the 
      voicemail context of the extension. You can leave it blank and it will 
      not check/show the voicemail status for that button (if its a queue 
      button or an extension without voicemail on). 

      You also have three new parameters in op_style.cfg:

        mail_margin_left
        mail_margin_top
        mail_scale

      to set the placement and size of the voicemail icon in the button.

.05
  Apr 17th 2004

  - Fixed a typo that prevented the applet from working.

.04
  Apr 16th 2004

    - Changed configuration files

        The configuration files are different: in version .03 the
        op_server.cfg had the button configuration and layout. In version
        .04 that information is stored in op_buttons.cfg. There are 2 new
        parameters in op_buttons.cfg, extension and icon.

        op_server.cfg is now used for the parameters of the op_server
        itself, like port to listent to, security code, debug level. You
        don't have to modify op_server.pl anymore. All configuration is done
        in the cfg files.

        There is a new configuration file: op_style.cfg with the style and
        size of the buttons.

     - Added Queues buttons

         You can display call queues on a button. Just put the name
         of the queue as the channel name.

     - Reconnection to Asterisk Manager port

         The op_server now tries to reconnect to Asterisk Manager
         port in case of disconnection. So if you restart Asterisk
         you don't need to restart the op_server.pl, it will reconnect
         by itself.

     - Totally redone flash movie: operator_panel3.swf
     
         The flash applet in version .04 is totally rewriten. IÏt 
         has no bitmaps. All graphics are vector based, so you can
         change the style and sizes without loosing detail. There
         is no timer or status on each button in order to save space.
         You can see the status of a channel by passing the mouse
         over the red oval.

         The new op_server.pl is compatible with the flash applet
         of previous versions (operator_panel.swf), with fixed 24 
         buttons display, timers, and scrolling info on each channel.
