SUPPORT 
OPEN SOURCE 
SOFTWARE

First of all thank you for considering to support this project!

Every developer knows how viable Open Source Software has become. Open Source
Software is used in many open and closed (commercial) projects. 

"Giving back" to projects you rely on is important. It is a core principle of
Open Source, it makes it tick. It also shows that you value what the developer
does. It's a fundamental morale booster.

It's not everybody's cup of tea to give back by contributing code. This is why
I have outlined a couple of ways to support the project in different ways
below. It really doesn't matter if you are a company or an individual. But I'd
like to emphasize that I really would like to see support from anybody that
profits from this project.

If you enjoy working with this library and this open source project is of great
use to you or your company, please consider supporting it through donations, by
buying commercial support or by sponsoring a feature.

Sponsor a Feature
-----------------
Sponsoring a feature is new way to support the project. All features will be
open sourced and immediately made available under the same permissive license
for everybody.  

In order to sponsor a project write a mail to nperson@gmx.de with the subject
`Sponsor a feature`, stating which payment method you prefer and which feature
you'd like to sponsor. I'll then respond with further details.

* Face Detection (PHP), € 400
Face detection in pure PHP, will be added to `Media\Info\Image`. In turn
`Media\Process\Image` methods which currently take a gravity will be modified
to allow receiving coordinates from the face detection.

* GMagick Adapter, € 300
The brand-new GMagick adapter will allow you swap out the Imagick adapter while
and for those who prefer more performant image processing.
				
* Faststart for MPEG4 videos, € 50
Videos that have been faststarted will immediately start playing and not wait
until the file is downloaded. This feature adds support for giving MPEG4 videos
this post-processing treatment improving the overall experience on HTML5 video.
// ...
Media\Process::factory("file.mp4")->faststart();
// ...
					
* Crush Images, € 100 
This feature will provide means to crush most images by using either pngcrush
or jpegtran.
// ...
Media\Process::factory("file.png")->crush();
// ...

* Document to Text Conversion, € 200
Allows any document (PDF) to converted to plain text by leveraging tools to
extract text.
// ...
Media\Process::factory("file.pdf")->convert("text/plain");
// ...
