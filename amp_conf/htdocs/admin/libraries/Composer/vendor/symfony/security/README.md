Security Component
==================

The Security component provides a complete security system for your web
application. It ships with facilities for authenticating using HTTP basic or
digest authentication, interactive form login or X.509 certificate login, but
also allows you to implement your own authentication strategies. Furthermore,
the component provides ways to authorize authenticated users based on their
roles.
