-- Change primary key on globals..it is nonsense to have the key as variable,value
-- as that would allow duplicates

-- People using SVN-HEAD could get very confused by the 'applications' module that
-- was nearly going in before the work on FeatureCodes was done
-- Following line will remove 'applications' from the modules, it's a bad fix but
-- might stops loads of ppl asking on #freepbx !!!!

DELETE FROM modules WHERE modulename = 'applications';
